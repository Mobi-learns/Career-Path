            JEE Advanced (formerly known as IIT JEE) is the second phase of the JEE examination and is usually conducted
            after the JEE Main exam. It is an important test for engineering aspirants (especially for those who are
            seeking admission in premier engineering institutes such as IITs). JEE Advanced is a computer-based exam and
            is usually conducted by seven different Indian IITs (IIT Kharagpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Roorkee, IIT Madras, IIT
            Kanpur, IIT Delhi and IIT Guwahati) on a rotational basis.

            The entrance exam consists of two papers – Paper 1 and Paper 2. It is also carried out in two stages (or
            ‘shifts’) that are held on the same day. It is mandatory for all the students to appear for both papers in
            order to be eligible for the merit list. Candidates are granted admissions to various undergraduate courses
            as well as masters and dual degree programs offered by IITs based on marks scored or ranks secured in the
            JEE Advanced examination.
