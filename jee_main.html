            JEE Main is a computer-based online test conducted by National Testing Agency for students aspiring to
            pursue undergraduate courses in top engineering institutes in India. JEE Main is the first phase of the IIT
            Joint Entrance Exam. The entrance examination till 2020 was conducted in two sessions and candidates could
            take the exam either in the month of January or in April. The candidates could further opt to appear for one
            exam or both the exams. The better of two NTA scores was considered by the exam conducting authority in
            preparing the ranks/merit list. More significantly, students are granted admission to IITs, CFITs, NITs, and
            other Government funded technical institutes based on the marks obtained in JEE Main. Also, the top 2,50,000
            students from JEE Main will qualify to appear for JEE Advanced.,<br>

            However, as per the latest update from the officials, JEE Main 2021 exam is being held four times a year. It
            will start from February 2021 and go on until May 2021 <br> <br>

            JEE Main will consist of three papers. Paper 1 will be for students who are planning to take B.Tech courses,
            whereas Paper 2A will be for B.Arch programs and Paper 2B will be for B.Planning courses. NTA has introduced
            a new exam pattern for the upcoming 2021 exam. Meanwhile, the registration and application process for the
            February session started in December. This time JEE Main (Paper 1) will be conducted in four sessions namely
            February, March, April and May sessions. However, B. Arch and B. Planning papers (papers 2A and 2B) will be
            held only twice a year in the months of February and May 2021. Further details are provided below.

            Students appearing for class 12 board exams with Physics and Maths as their compulsory subjects are eligible
            to appear for JEE Main 2021. 2019-20 pass-outs are also eligible to appear for this exam. However, before
            applying for the exam candidates should fulfil the JEE Main eligibility criteria. Failing to do so will
            result in the rejection of the application.
